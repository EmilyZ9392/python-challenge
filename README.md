PyBank

Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. The script analyzes the records to provide the follwoing insights:


-Total number of months in the dataset


-Net total of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


-Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes


-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

the PyBank repository includes the financial record (under the 'resources' file), Python script (main.py), as well as a text file with the above financial summary (under the 'analysis' file). 



PyPoll




For this challenge, I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following from a data set containing poll information for a small town:

-Total number of votes


-A complete list of candidates who received votes


-The percentage of votes per candidate as well as the number of votes each received


-The winner of the election (candiate with most votes)

the PyPoll repository includes the poll data ('resources' file), the Python script (main.py), as well as the text file with the above election results ('analysis' file).
